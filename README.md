# bmi_flutter

The app calculates the user’s body mass index (BMI) based on their weight and height. The user inputs their weight and height in the app, and the app calculates their BMI using the formula: BMI = weight (kg) / [height (m)]^2.

The app has a simple and elegant user interface, with two text fields for the user to input their weight and height, and a button to calculate their BMI. The app also displays a message about the user’s body condition based on their BMI.

The app is built using Flutter, a popular open-source mobile application development framework created by Google. The app is available on GitHub and is free to use and modify.
